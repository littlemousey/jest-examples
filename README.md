Jest testing examples project

## Examples

In this project Jest is used with Webpack, Vanilla JS without a framework.
The examples include:

- Expect (to be true/false/equal)
- Test setup/teardown (beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll)
- Spy (check on call method)
- Mock
- Async testing
- Coverage

## Don't forget

- `it` and `test` can be used equally
- does not matter if the test file is named `spec.js` or `test.js`
